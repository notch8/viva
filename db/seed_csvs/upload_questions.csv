1,Upload,Develop a Comprehensive Heart Failure Nursing Care Plan,"<h3>Understanding Nursing Care Plans for Patients with Heart Failure</h3><p>Heart failure is a complex clinical syndrome that occurs when the heart is unable to pump sufficient blood to meet the body's metabolic demands. It affects approximately 6.2 million adults in the United States and is a leading cause of hospitalization among adults over the age of 65.</p><p>Effective management of heart failure requires a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach. Nursing care plans are essential tools that help organize assessments, interventions, and evaluations to address the specific needs of patients with heart failure.</p><p>Key components of a nursing care plan for heart failure include:</p><ul><li>Assessment of cardiac function and symptoms (dyspnea, orthopnea, fatigue, edema)</li><li>Monitoring of fluid status and weight</li><li>Medication management (diuretics, ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers)</li><li>Activity and exercise recommendations</li><li>Dietary modifications (sodium and fluid restrictions)</li><li>Patient education on self-management strategies</li><li>Psychosocial support</li></ul>","<h4>Assignment:</h4><p>You are caring for Mr. James Thompson, a 72-year-old male admitted to the medical-surgical unit with acute decompensated heart failure (NYHA Class III). His medical history includes hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and a previous myocardial infarction 5 years ago.</p><p>Current assessment findings include:</p><ul><li>Vital signs: BP 152/88 mmHg, HR 92 bpm, RR 24/min, O2 saturation 91% on room air</li><li>Bilateral crackles in lung bases</li><li>3+ pitting edema in lower extremities</li><li>Weight gain of 4.5 kg over the past week</li><li>Decreased appetite and increased fatigue</li><li>Lab values: BNP 850 pg/mL, Na+ 133 mEq/L, K+ 3.8 mEq/L, BUN 32 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.4 mg/dL</li></ul><p><strong>Develop a comprehensive nursing care plan for Mr. Thompson that addresses his heart failure exacerbation. Your care plan should include at least three nursing diagnoses with corresponding goals, interventions, and evaluation criteria. Also include specific patient education elements that would be essential before discharge.</strong></p><p>Please upload your nursing care plan as a document file. Your submission will be evaluated on its comprehensiveness, clinical reasoning, evidence-based interventions, and attention to holistic patient needs.</p>",Mathematics,Applied Science,,4
2,Upload,Develop a Pediatric Asthma Action Plan for School and Home,"<h3>Pediatric Asthma Management and Education</h3> <p>Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases of childhood, affecting approximately 6 million children under 18 years of age in the United States. Effective asthma management requires a coordinated approach between healthcare providers, families, schools, and the community.</p> <p>Pediatric asthma management presents unique challenges compared to adult care, including:</p> <ul> <li>Developmental considerations in symptom recognition and medication administration</li> <li>Need for family and caregiver education</li> <li>School and childcare coordination</li> <li>Age-appropriate education strategies</li> <li>Impact on growth, development, and quality of life</li> <li>Environmental trigger assessment in multiple settings</li> </ul> <p>The Asthma Action Plan is a critical tool that helps children, families, and other caregivers recognize worsening asthma symptoms and respond appropriately with medication adjustments and environmental modifications.</p>","<h4>Assignment:</h4> <p>You are caring for Emily Roberts, an 8-year-old female recently discharged from the hospital following her second asthma exacerbation this year. She has moderate persistent asthma and lives with her mother and younger brother in an apartment. Emily is entering third grade next month.</p> <p>Current clinical information:</p> <ul> <li>Prescribed medications: Fluticasone 88 mcg inhaler (2 puffs twice daily), Albuterol inhaler (2 puffs as needed for symptoms), oral prednisone taper following recent exacerbation</li> <li>Pulmonary function tests show FEV1 of 78% of predicted when stable</li> <li>Identified triggers include respiratory infections, exercise, pollen, and exposure to cigarette smoke (a neighbor smokes in the shared hallway)</li> <li>Emily's mother works full-time and reports difficulty remembering the controller medication routine</li> <li>Emily participates in soccer and swimming but has missed several practices due to asthma symptoms</li> </ul> <p><strong>Create a comprehensive pediatric asthma action plan for Emily that can be used both at home and school. Your plan should include:</strong></p> <ol> <li>Clear identification of green (well-controlled), yellow (caution), and red (emergency) zones with corresponding symptoms and actions</li> <li>Medication instructions with age-appropriate considerations</li> <li>Specific recommendations for school staff, including PE teachers</li> <li>Strategies to improve medication adherence</li> <li>Environmental control measures for both home and school</li> <li>Family education plan with developmentally appropriate teaching strategies for Emily</li> </ol> <p>Please upload your pediatric asthma action plan as a document file. Your submission should demonstrate understanding of pediatric asthma management principles, family-centered care, and interdisciplinary collaboration.</p>",Law,Life Science,Education,6
