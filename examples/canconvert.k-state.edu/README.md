This directory contains two files:

- `qti.csv` :: Generated from the template provided at https://dl.sps.northwestern.edu/canvas/2021/06/add-quiz-questions-to-canvas-by-converting-csv-files-to-qti-zip-files/
- `qti.xml` :: Generated by uploading the `qti.csv` to https://canconvert.k-state.edu/qti/

These are here as examples from which to build.

The instructions for generating the `qti.csv` are as follows:

> * `Column A` is the type of question: MC (multiple choice) and MR (multiple response). For True/False questions, use MC.
> * `Column B` is not used but must be there.
> * `Column C` is the point value of the question. It can be between 0-100 and up to two decimal places (3.33)
> * `Column D` is the question body. 
> * `Column E` is the correct answer. The numbers 1-5 each correspond to the one of the possible answers listed in `column F-J`. Use 1 to indicate a, 2 to indicate b, 3 to indicate c, 4 to indicate d, and 5 to in dicate e. For True/False questions, use 1 for True and 0 for False. Clear any unused cells.
> * `Columns F-J` are the possible answer choices. You can have 2 or more.
