There are two directories:

- `classic-quiz-format`
- `new-quiz-format`

These directories contain quizzes of the given format (e.g. "Classic" and "New") exported from Canvas.

The `new-quiz-format/MigratedClassicQuizExport` directory is the "New Quiz" format of the `classic-quiz-format/ClassicQuestionsExport` directory contents.  The migration is unidirectional, that is you can migrate the "Classic" quiz to a "New" quiz format (creating a copy).  You cannot migrate a "New" quiz to a "Classic" format.
