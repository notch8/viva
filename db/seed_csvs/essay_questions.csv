However, situations may arise where family members disagree with documented wishes, or where the patient's current non-verbal cues seem to contradict previously stated preferences.</p><p>In addition, nurses must navigate complex issues related to pain management, palliative sedation, withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments, and cultural or religious considerations that influence end-of-life care preferences.</p></div><div class=""question-prompt""><p>You are caring for Mrs. Rodriguez, an 82-year-old patient with advanced dementia and newly diagnosed metastatic cancer.

Effective nurse leaders must develop competencies in change management to successfully implement and sustain improvements in patient care delivery.</p><p>Change theories such as Lewin's Three-Step Model (Unfreezing-Change-Refreezing) and Kotter's 8-Step Process provide frameworks for understanding the dynamics of organizational change. However, implementing change in healthcare settings presents unique challenges, including professional autonomy concerns, interdisciplinary collaboration requirements, and the direct impact on patient outcomes.</p><p>Nurse leaders must anticipate and address barriers to change, which may include resistance from staff, resource limitations, organizational culture factors, and competing priorities within the healthcare system.</p></div><div class=""question-prompt""><p>You are the nurse manager of a medical-surgical unit that has experienced an increase in hospital-acquired pressure injuries (HAPIs) over the past six months.
