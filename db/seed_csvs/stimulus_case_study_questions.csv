2,Scenario,"Mr. Henderson, a 78-year-old male, presents to the emergency department with complaints of progressive shortness of breath over the past 3 days. He reports a productive cough with yellow-green sputum and a fever of 101.2°F (38.4°C) at home this morning. His medical history includes COPD, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes. He uses supplemental oxygen at home (2L/min via nasal cannula). On assessment, vital signs are: BP 148/92 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 28/min, SpO2 88% on room air, and temperature 38.6°C.
